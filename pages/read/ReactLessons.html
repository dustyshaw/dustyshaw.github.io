    <h1>My React Native Learning Journey</h1>
    <p>Recently, I took it upon myself to finally learn a full Javascript framework. Coming from a .NET background (and
        being slightly too attached to my C#) I was a bit nervous and confused. There seemed to be so many differences in
        how you render and comput components. However, with the amazing help of the internet and lot's of YouTube
        videos, I was able to create my first React Native app.</p>
    <p>My goals for my app was to create a simple nutrition app that would help you to keep track of calories that you
        eat every day. </p>
        <p>I thought this idea was simple enough to get a handle on rendering JavaScript components, but
        also complicated enought that I would learn all the useful things about a library (like using databases and
        API's to generate dynamic data).</p>

    <h2 id="why-react-native">Why React Native?</h2>
    <p>React Native stems from one of the most popular JavaScript front-end libraries: React js. While React js is a
        front-end component library built off of JavaScript, React Native is just for creating native apps (the kind of
        apps you find in the app store on iOS, Android, and Windows). Confusing right!?</p>
    <p>After some research into different frameworks for mobile development, I found that React Native has some
        benefits: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Components can be reaused for web based applications written in React js (awesome! Reduced duplication)</li>
        <li>Write platform specific code with just JavaScript (great! Don't have to learn Java or that pesky
            <i>Swift</i> to make mobile apps)</li>
        <li>Seems faster than other front-end frameworks like Angular</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the end of the day, the programming language you choose might not make as much of a difference than you think,
        so I try not to stress this part too much.</p>

    <h2 id="planning-my-practice-project">Planning my Practice Project</h2>
    <p>To begin, I decided to pencil in some designs of what I want my app to look like. This helps me understand the
        different functions that my app requires, and it gives me a great jumping off point.</p>
    <img src="/pages/read/images/SimpleNutritionDesign.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Design for Simple Nutrition app" />
    <p>Now that I had the general layout of what I wanted the app to look like, it was time to develop some
        requirements.</p>
    <p>Users should be able to...</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a food item to a specific day.</li>
        <li>See an overview of how many calories they have eaten per day.</li>
        <li>See the macros of what they have eaten for that day (protein, carbs, fats)</li>
        <li>Scan a food item to find it via a food API</li>
    </ol>
    <p>With these requirements, I now know what the minimum viable product is.</p>

    <p>As I am working on Windows, I downloaded npm so I can start my project:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <div class="code-header">
        </div>
        <div class="code-content">
            <p>npx create-expo-app SimpleNutrition</p>

            <p>cd SimpleNutrition</p>
            <p>npx expo start</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code-footer">
            <p>Powershell</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>After running the app, I got used to using the Windows emulators.</p>
