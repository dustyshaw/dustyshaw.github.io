    <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
    <p>I decided to create a visualization of <a href="">Conway's famous "Game of Life,"</a> a popular cellular autonoma
      algorithm. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a 2D grid. Each cell can be described as alive or dead.</li>
      <li>For any given cell, if it is alive with greater than 3 living neighbor cells, it will not live to the next generation, effectively dying of overpopulation.</li>
      <li>A dead cell will come alive during the next generation if it has 2 living neighbor cells as if by reproduction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are three rules to the Game of Life:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If a cell has more than three neighbors and is alive, it will die.</li>
      <li>If a dead cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, it will come alive.</li>
      <li>If a living cell has less than 2 living neighbors, it will die.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here was my process in creating this project.</p>

    <h2>Phase One</h2>
    <p>The first phase was to actually learn Clojure. There are a lot of concepts in Clojure that I haven't seen in other languages.</p>

    <h4>Learn Basics of Functional Programming</h4>
    <p>What is “functional programming?” There are no variables.  Uses something called “lambda calculus” and, no, this isn’t the derivative and integral kind of calculus. </p>

    
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Things are immutable, meaning they can’t be changed later.  Why are immutable things great? You avoid errors using race conditions.  </p>
    
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> So... many... parenthesis.</p>

    <h4>Learn Clojure Syntax</h4>
    <p>Clojure Koans.  Clojure koans mysteriously and vaguely walks you through the prefixed formatting of clojure functions.  It walks you through data types including sets and sequences which (spoiler alert!) came very much in handy with the Game of Life project.</p>

      <div class="code-content">
        <pre>
(defn hello-world []
  (println “hello world”))
(hello-world)
        </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="code-footer">
        <p>"Hello World" in Clojure</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>What is Clojure?</h3>
    <p>Clojure is a not-so-popular programming language that was written in order to create documents.</p>
    <p>It is a functional programming language, meaning that there are not classes or objects like there are in Object
      Oriented programming languages like C#, JavaScript, or Python.</p>
    <p>There are some benefits to using a Functional Programming language:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Things are immutable. Because you don't instantiate anything or any classes, things never change. This can
        remove a lot of bugs.</li>
      <li>Efficient</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase Two</h2>
    <p>To make my project more interesting visually, I wanted to add a GUI.</p>
