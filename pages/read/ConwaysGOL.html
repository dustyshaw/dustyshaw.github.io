  <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
  <p>I decided to create a visualization of <a href="">Conway's famous "Game of Life,"</a> a popular cellular autonoma
    algorithm. </p>
  <p>There are three rules to the Game of Life:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If a cell has more than three neighbors and is alive, it will die.</li>
    <li>If a dead cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, it will come alive.</li>
    <li>If a living cell has less than 2 living neighbors, it will die.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This is some more text.</p>

  <h3>What is Clojure?</h3>
  <p>Clojure is a not-so-popular programming language that was written in order to create documents.</p>
  <p>It is a functional programming language, meaning that there are not classes or objects like there are in Object Oriented programming languages like C#, JavaScript, or Python.</p>
  <p>There are some benefits to using a Functional Programming language:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Things are immutable. Because you don't instantiate anything or any classes, things never change. This can remove a lot of bugs.</li>
    <li>Efficient</li>
  </ul>
